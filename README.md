# Diffie-Hellman-algorithm
## The Diffie-Hellman algorithm is being used to establish a shared secret that can be used for secret communications while exchanging data over a public network using the elliptic curve to generate points and get the secret key using the parameters. 
 
### For the sake of simplicity and practical implementation of the algorithm, we will consider only 4 variables one prime J and K (a primitive root of J) and two private values A and B.
### K and J are both publicly available numbers. Users (say JACK and KING) pick private values A and B and they generate a key and exchange it publicly, the opposite person received the key and from that generates a secret key after which they have the same secret key to encrypt.
